For now to keep binaries out of git, download dependencies separately:

Dependencies:

winiso = Windows isochronous modifications by Joshua Blake <joshblake@gmail.com>

1. Download pre-built binaries libusbx-winiso.zip from https://www.dropbox.com/s/madoye1ayaoajet/libusbx-winiso.zip
2. Unzip into the depends folder such that the resulting folder structure ends up looking like:
./depends/libusbx/
./depends/libusbx/include/
./depends/libusbx/MS64/
3. Done
